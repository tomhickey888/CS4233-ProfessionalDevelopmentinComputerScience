## Introduction
This project is intended to be the pinaccle of my bachellor's degree work.  This purpose of this project was to design software to perform CPU-intensive tasks in parallel using three different aspects of the multiprocessing module in Python.  The three methods of communication between the main process and the subprocesses that were evaluated were simplex pipes, duplex pipes, and the multiprocessing pool module.  By recording the processing time of each the efficiency of the three different methods of communication can be measured quantitatively.

- Activity Diagram.jpeg – This is the activity diagram that outlines the control flow of the main.py script from start to finish.  Also found in the Requirements Analysis document.
- Sequence Diagram.jpeg – This is the sequence diagram that outlines the interaction between the software and the Python script in time sequence.  Also found in the Requirements Analysis document.
- State-Transition Diagram.jpeg – This is the state transition diagram that outlines the states that the driver script of this project has throughout its functionality, and the events under which the states change.  Also found in the Requirements Analysis document.
- Use Case #1.jpeg – This is the use case diagram that outlines the interactions between the programmer and the software given that the programmer is trying to determine the overhead built into each multiprocessing module tested in the software.  Also found in the Requirements Analysis document.
- Use Case #2.jpeg – This is the use case diagram that outlines the interactions between the programmer and the software given that the programmer is trying to determine which multiprocessing module tested in the software will be best for their use in an outside project.  Also found in the Requirements Analysis document.
