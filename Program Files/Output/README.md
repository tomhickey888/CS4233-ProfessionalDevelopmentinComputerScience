## Introduction
This project is intended to be the pinnacle of my bachelor's degree work.  This purpose of this project was to design software to perform CPU-intensive tasks in parallel using three different aspects of the multiprocessing module in Python.  The three methods of communication between the main process and the subprocesses that were evaluated were simplex pipes, duplex pipes, and the multiprocessing pool module.  By recording the processing time of each the efficiency of the three different methods of communication can be measured quantitatively.
